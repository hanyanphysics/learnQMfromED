# Understanding Quantum Mechanics, Qubit by Qubit.

This project combines notes and Python codes to teach undergraduate-level quantum mechanics, focusing on the qubit system perspective.

Rather than solving Schr√∂dinger equations for continuous wave functions, we begin with the Hilbert space of a few qubits and revisit key concepts of quantum mechanics. To calculate quantities beyond the analytical regime, we introduce the Exact Diagonalization method.

This complimentary approach helps students to understand quantum mechanics better, and is beneficial for those who have an interest in quantum many-body systems and quantum information.

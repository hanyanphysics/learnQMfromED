# Understanding Quantum Mechanics, Qubit by Qubit.

This project is a combination of notes and python codes to teach undergraduate quantum mechanics from the perspective of qubit system. 

Instead of solving Shrodinger equations for continuous wave functions, we start from the Hilbert space of a few qubits, and revisit the main concepts of quantum mechanics. We will introduce Exact Diagonalization to help us compute quantities beyond the analytical regime.

This complimentary perspective is helpful for students interested in quantum many-body systems and quantum information.
